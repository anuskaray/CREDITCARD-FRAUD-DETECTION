# CREDITCARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
In this project we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud and find the best one.

# Introduction 
In this project we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud and find the best one.
# Data Description 
the data we have is an numerical data that represents the details of the transaction , cardholders name , address etc which was ran through PCA model
# Our Goals: 
Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us.
Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. (NearMiss Algorithm)
Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
Create a Neural Network and compare the accuracy to our best classifier.
Understand common mistaked made with imbalanced datasets.
# Outline: 
## I. Understanding our data
## II. Preprocessing

## III. Random UnderSampling and Oversampling

## IV. Testing
